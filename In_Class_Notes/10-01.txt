**Chapter 3: Conditional Statements**
- There are three kinds of conditional statements. We use conditional statements
to help us make decisions based on what happens. 

    - Single Selection Conditional Statement (If Statement)
        • If it rains[condition] then I will take an umbrella[decision]
        • If the condition is true, then the decision will be executed. 
        • If the condition is false, nothing will happen. 

**Syntax**
if (condition):
    decision


**Example**
if (gpa >= 3.8):
    print("You are an honors student.") #this is the body of the if statement#


    

    - Double Selection Conditional Statement (If Else Statement)
        • If it rains[condition], then I will take an umbrella[statement 1] else I will 
        not take am umbrella[statement 2].
        • This is used only when an event has only two mutually exclusive outcomes. These
        are events that cannot happen at the same time. Example: rolling a dice, throwing
        a coin. 

**Syntax**
if (condition):
    statement 1
else:
    statement 2


**Example**
if (gpa >= 3.8):
    print("You are an honors student.")
else:
    print("You are not an honors student.")




    - Multiple Selection Conditional Statement (If .. Elif ... Elif ... Elif ... Else Statement)
        • This is used only when an event has n mutually exclusive outcomes. These are events
        that cannot happen at the same. 

**Syntax**
if (condition 1):
    statement 1
elif (condition 2):
    statement 2
elif (condition 3):
    statement 3
elif (condition 4):
    statement 4
else:
    decision 5










**Comparision Operators**
- These are the comparison operators that we use in Python

== Equal to operator. Test for equality.       Example is a == b.
!= Not equal to operator. Test for inequality. Example is a != b.
>  Greater than operator. Test for greater.    Example is a > b
<  Less than operator. Test for less.          Example is a < b
>= Greater than or equal to operator.          Example is a >= b
<= Less than or equal to operator.             Example is a <= b


= The assignment operator has right to left associativity. 
For example, a = b. So b is assigned to a.
