Test moved to next week 12/3

First Part
    - Write a program

Second Part
    - Trace a program

Third Part
    - For loop inside of a for loop only, wont have anything else. 




**For Loops**
    - There are 3 different kinds of for loops. 
        1. for i in range (5):
            print (i)
        - In this case, the starting value for the loop counter is zero. 
        - The number in the range is excluded, so it'll be 0-4. 

        An equivalent while loop can be
            i = 0
            while (i < 5):
                print (i)
                i += 1


        2. for i in range (1,6):
            print (i)
        - In this case, the starting value is 1. 
        - The numbers in the range will be 1-5. 

        An equivalent while loop can be
            i = 0
            while (i < 6):
                print(i) 
                i += 1


        3. for i in range (1, 11, 2):
                print(i)
        - In this case, the starting value for the loop counter is 1. 
        - The numbers is the range will be 1-10. 
        - We increment by 2.

            for i in range (9, 0, -2):
                print(i)
        - In this case, the starting value for the loop counter is 9. 
        - The numbers in the range will be 9 to 1, 0 is not included. 
        - We decrement by 2. 
            



**Factorials**
    - There are two different ways to solve factorials, recursively or iteration. We will
    focus on iterations. 
    - 0! = 0
    - 1! = 1
    - 2! = 2
    - n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) ...


    Example:
        - Write a program that obtains a non negative integer from the user and outputs its corresponding factorial. 
        - We will be using for loops and interations for this
    
    print("Enter a non negative integer: ")
    n = int(input())
    factorial = 1
    for j in range (n, 0, -1):
        factorial *= j
    print(str(n) + '!=' + str(fact))
    - So if a user enters 5, it will be 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

    - We can also go from smaller to larger, it is the same just the for loop changes. 
    - But the first method is more natural. 
    for j in range (1, n+1):




**Nested Loops**
    - Nested for loops are useful for matrices and any 2 dimensional structure like Excal, anything on a plane. 

    Example:
        for i in range (1,5): -> this is the outer for loop that is responsible for the number of rows. 
            for j in range (1,5): -> this is the inner for loop that is responsible for the number of columns. 
                print('*', end = ' ') 
            print()


        - The body of the inner for loop is the print('*', end = ' ')
        - The body of the outer for loop is everything below it. 
        -
