**Math Module**
    - Python comes with a standard math module to support advanced
    mathematical operations. 
    - In order to use the math module, we simply do "import math" at 
    the top of our file. 
        
        - Module: python code located in another file

        - Function: a list of statements that can be executes by referring
        to the function's name. 

        - Function Call: the process of invoking a function

        - Argument: the item passed to a function. Functions are allowed to 
        have multiple arguments. 




**Commonly Used Math Functions**
    - For the most part, these functions require the math in front so it'll be like
    math.pow(4, 2) or math.floor(2.3)
    - Remember to import math or you'll get an error message. 
        - ceil(x)
        - factorial(x)
        - floor(x)
        - fabs(x)
        - pow(x)
        - sqrt(x)
