**Division: Integer Rounding**
    - To do division, we use the / symbol. 
    - It returns a floating point number. 
        • Example: 20/10 = 2.0
        • Example: 16/2 = 8.0


    - We can also use the // operator. This can work in two ways. It is 
    used to round down the result of the division to the smallest whole
    number. 
    - If both numbers are integers, the result is an integer. 
    - If one number is a float, the result is a float. 
        • Example: 20 // 10 = 2
        • Example: 5.0 // 2 = 2.0 (even though its 2.5, it rounds down and returns float)




**Modulo**
    - Represented by the % symbol. And what it does it essentially evaluates
    the remainder of the division of two integers. 
        • Example: 23 % 10 = 3
        • Example: 9 % 4 = 1
        • Example: 9 % 5 = 4
