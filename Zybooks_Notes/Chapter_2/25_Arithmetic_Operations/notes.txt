**Basics**
    - Espression: a combination of items, like variables, literals, operators, 
    and parenthesis. And all that evaluates to a value like 2 * (x+1). It's
    usually on the right side of the expression. 

    - Literal: a specific value in code like 2, 3, 4

    - Operator: a symbol that performs calculations, like +, -, *, /




**Evaluation of Expressions**
    - An expression evaluates a value, which then replaces the expression. 
    - If x is 5, then x+1 now equals 6, and y = x+1 assigns y with 6.
