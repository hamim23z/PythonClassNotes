**Compound Operators**
    - These are special operators that provide a shorthand way to
    update a variable. Common ones are below
        - age += 1 means age = age + 1
        - age -= 1 means age = age - 1
        - age *= 1 means age = age * 1
        - age /= 1 means age = age / 1
        - age %= 1 means age = age % 1




**Important Note**
    - Commas are not allowed for literals, like not allowed at all.
