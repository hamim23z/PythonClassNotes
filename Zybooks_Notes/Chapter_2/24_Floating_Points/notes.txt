**Floating Point Numbers and Scientific Notation**
    - A floating point number is like a real number such as 98.6, 0.1, 3.14. 
    - We call it floating point just because of the decimal. 

        - Float: data type for floating point numbers
    
        - Floating Point Literal: written with the fractional part, like 1.0 or 5.0




**Overflow**
    - Occurs when a value is too large to be stored in the memory allocated by the
    interpreter. 
    - In general, floating points should be used to represent quantities that can be
    measured so it doesn't cause overflow errors. 




**Manipulating Floating Point Output**
    - Some floating points have a lot of numbers after the decimal and we don't want that, 
    typically the first two or three after the decimal is good for us. 
    - There is a way for us to get the number of decimals and we do so by
        â€¢ print(f'{myFloat:.2f}') and myFloat is what you name it. .2f can be changed to 
        become .3, .4, etc. However many decimals after you want.
