**Rules for Identifiers**
    - Identifier: aka a name. It is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscore. 
    It must start with a letter or underscore. 

    - Case Sensitive: Python is case sensitive, so uppercase and lowercase letters
    differ. 

    - Reserved Words: aka keywords. These are words that are part of the language
    and cannot be used as a programmer defined name. Example is and, True, False




**Some Reserved Keywords in Python**
    - False
    - None
    - True
    - and
    - as
    - assert
    - async
    - await
    - break
    - class
    - continue
    - def
    - del
    - elif

    And there are a lot more.
