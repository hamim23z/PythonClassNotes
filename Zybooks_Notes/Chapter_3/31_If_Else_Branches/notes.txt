**Branch Basics**
    - A branch is a sequence of statements only executed under a certain condition. 

    - If Branch:
        - An if branch is a branch taken only when the expressed is true. 

    - If Else Branch:
        - An if else branch has two branches. If the condition is true/met, the first
        branch is executed. If it's false/not met, then the second branch is executed. 

    - If ElseIf Else Branch:
        - This is an extension of the if else branch. If there are two+ different outcomes, 
        then we use this. If the condition is met, first branch. If it is not met, then second
        branch, if it's still not met, then third branch. And if it never met, then it goes to
        the else branch and executes. Else branch can be thought of default. But the else part
        is optional.
