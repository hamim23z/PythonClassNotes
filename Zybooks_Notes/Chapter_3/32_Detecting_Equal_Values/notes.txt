**Detecting if two items are equal using an if statement**
    - An if statement executes a group of statements if an expression is true. 
    - These statements must be indented, usually 4 spaces. 
    - We use the equality operator, which is ==, and it evaluates to True if the 
    left and right sides are equal. 




**Equality and Inequality Operators**
    - We know the equality operator checks whether two values are equal. 
    - The inequality operator is used to check if the two sides are not equal. 
    It is used as !=. If we have a!=b, then it means a is not equal to b. 
    - And whenever we use == or !-, it evaluates to a boolean value of True or False. 




**If Else Statement**
    - An if else statement executes one group of statements when the condition is true. And another
    group of statements if the condition is false. Hence, if true run this, else run this instead. 




**Multi Branch If-Else Statements**
    - An if else statement can be extended to have 3+ branches. And we use the elif keyword to showcase
    it, which stands for else if. If expression1 is true, end. If expression 2 is false, go to expression2
    and if that is false, go to expression3. Etc Etc. Only one branch will execute.
