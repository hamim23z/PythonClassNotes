**Basic Ranges with gaps**
    - Ranges contain gaps. For example, movie theaters  give ticket discounts to children (anyone 12 and under) 
    and seniors (anyone 65 and older). The gap is the group of people aged 13 to 64. An if-else statement can be 
    used to detect such ranges with gaps. We would essentially just use an if elif else. 




**Ranges with gaps using logical operators**
    - We can use logical operators to explicitly detect ranges with an upper and lower bound. We can and often
    times use the and operator and then or operator, with some form of parenthesis.
