**Multiple Distinct if Statements**
    - Multiple if statements often look similar to a multi branch if else statement but it is different because
    each if statement is independent and more than one branch can execute.
    - It's basically saying how is have a variable set, to a certain number. And that number meets the condition
    for three different if statements, those three statements will execute and do whatever we have it set to do. 




**Nested If Else Statements**
    - An if else statement is just inside another if else statement.
