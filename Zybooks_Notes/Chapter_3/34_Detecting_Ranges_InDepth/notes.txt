**Relational Operators**
    - A relational operator checks how one operand's value relates to one another. 
    - Some common and most used are <, >, <=, >=. 




**Operator Chaining**
    - In Python, we can do operator chaining. This means that we are allowed to do
    a < b < c. And this means b is greater than a but less than c.

    - When we chain operators, it's read from left to right, so a < b is evaluated first. 
    If that is true, then we evaluate b < c. And if a < b is false, we stop eveluating.

    - Example: Show x is less than y but greater than z. 
        - x < y but x > z
        - This can be shown as: z < x < y
