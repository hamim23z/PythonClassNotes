**Logical and, or, not**
    - A logical operator treats operands as being True or False and then it eveluates to
    True or False. 
    - For and: Both statements must be True so then it returns True. 
    - For or: Only one statement or both must be True so it returns True. 
    - For not: It just flips the sign essentially. True becomes False and False becomes True. 
    - Yes, the operators are lowercase. 




**Booleans and Logical Operators**
    - Boolean is True and False. We can assignment a boolean value so a variable. And also, 
    we can evaluate an expression that gives a Boolean.
