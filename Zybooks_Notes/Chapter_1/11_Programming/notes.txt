**Computer Programming Basics**
    - A computer program consists of instructions that execute one at a time. 
        - Input: program receives data from a file, keyboard, network, etc

        - Process: program performs computations on that data such as adding values
    
        - Output: program that puts the data somewhere such as a file, screen, network

    - Programs use variables to refer to data. We asign values to variables by using
    the equal sign. x = 2. 




**Computational Thinking**
    - Creating a sequence of instructions to solve a problem
        - Algorithms: a sequence of instructions that solves a problem.
