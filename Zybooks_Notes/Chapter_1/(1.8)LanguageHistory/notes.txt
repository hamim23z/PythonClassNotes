**Scripting Languages and Python**
    - Scripting Languages: execute programs without the need of compiling it. 

    - Script: a program whose instructions are executed by another program 
    called an interpreter. 

    - Backward Compatible: this means that older versions cannot run on newer
    versions. For example, Python 2.7 can't run on Python 3.x. Python is 
    an open source language.
