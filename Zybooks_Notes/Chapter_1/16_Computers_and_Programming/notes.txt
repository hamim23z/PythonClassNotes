**Switches**
    - Bits aka binary digits are known to be 0 and 1. 1 is on/true. 0 means off/false. 




**Processors and Memory**
    - To support different calculations, we use processors and memory
        - Processors: circuits that were created to process/execute a list of instructions. 
            â€¢ Nowadays, processors fit on a chip about the size of a postage stamp and they
            contain millions or billions of switches. 

        - Memory: this is where instructions are stored. It is a circuit that can store 0s
        and 1s in a series of addressed locations. 

        - Program/Application/App: programmer created sequence of instructions




**Writing Computer Programs**
    - Machine Instructions: instructions represented as 0s and 1s
    
    - Executable Program: a sequence of machine instructions

    - Assembly Language: low-level programming language that is intended to communicate 
    directly with a computer's hardware.

    - Compilers: programmer create compiler that are program that automatically translate
    high level language programs into executable programs.
