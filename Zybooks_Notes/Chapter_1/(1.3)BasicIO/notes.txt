**Basic Text Output**
- Text is output from a Python program using the built in print() function. 
    - Each print statement, prints its output on a new line automatically.
    - White spaces matter in Python, meaning we can actually print out blank spaces.
    - Any space, tab or newline is called white space. 

    - String: text enclosed in quotes. Can have letters, numbers, spaces, or symbols
        - Strings must be enclosed in "" or ''. 
        - Strings must start and end with the same kind of quotes.




**Output Variables and Multiple Values**
- The value of a variable can be printed out like so: print(variable_name)
- A single output line can have multiple strings and variables are separated by commas. And 
once we have the commas, a space character is automatically added between each. 




**Keeping Outputs on the Same Line**
- We know that when we use print(), each output is automatically on a new line. However, if 
we do end= ' ' inside of the print, then it keeps the output of the next on the same line. 
    - Make sure to end what you want to print by using your quotes and then put a commas
    after and then do the end = ' '
    - EXAMPLE: print("Hello, my name is: Hamim", end = ' ' )




**Moving Output to the Next Line**
- Outputs can be moved to the next line by using the newline character which is \n.
    - Escape Sequence: a string that has a special meaning. Other escape sequences exist
    which will be covered later. 
    - EXAMPLE: print("1\n2\n3\n4")




**Basic Input**
- The input() function is used to read input from a user. 
    - EXAMPLE: num_cars = input()
    - EXAMPLE: number = int(input())




**Converting Input Types**
- As we should know, '123' is different from 123. 
    - Type: determines how a value can behave. Strings are integers are types. 



**Input Prompt**
- Adding a string inside the parenthesis of input can display a prompt for the user. 
- This allows a message to pop up for the user and it is easy to understand. 
    - EXAMPLE: int(input("Please enter a number: "))
