**Syntax Errors**
- Violates a programming language's rules on how symbols can be combined to create
a program. 
- To avoid errors, frequently run your code. 
    - EXAMPLE: putting multiple print statements on the same line




**Runtime Errors**
- A programs syntaxt is correct but the program attempts an impossible operation
such as diving by zero or multiplying strings. 
- A runtime errors halts the program aka a crash of the program. 




**Logic Errors**
- When a program is logically flawed, this is often called a bug, 
    - EXAMPLE: 2*4 instead of 2*40




**Common Error Types**
- SyntaxError: The program contains invalid code that cannot be understood.
- IndentationError: The lines of the program are not properly indented.
- ValueError: An invalid value is used, which can occur if giving letters to int().
- NameError: The program tries to use a variable that does not exist.
- TypeError: An operation uses incorrect types, which can occur if adding an integer to a string.
