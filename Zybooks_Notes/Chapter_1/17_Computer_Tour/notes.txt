**Computer Components**
    - Input/Output Devices: a screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone,
    speakers, printers. 

    - Storage: a disk that stores files and other data, like program 
    files, pictures, music, videos, etc. You have an HDD and SSD, SSD
    is becoming more common and profound. Storage does not lose its
    content when the device is turned off. 

    - Memory(RAM): Random Access Memory and it temporarily holds data
    read from storage and is designed to any address can be accessed
    faster than from a disk. RAM loses its content when the device is
    turned off. 

    - Processor: it runs the computers programs by reading and executing
    instructions from memory, performing operations, and reading and 
    writing data. BIOS, OS, CPU.

    - Clock: a processors instructions execute at a rate that the processors
    clock runs at. It runs at a frequency, like 1MHz. 

    - Transistors: these are smaller switches that were integrated onto a 
    single chip called an integrated circuit. 

    


**Moore's Law**
    - The observation that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will 
    double every two years with minimal rise in cost. Gordon Moore discovered this 
    and he was a founder at Intel.
