**Whitespace and Precise Formatting**
    - Whitespace: any black space or new line. 




**Precision in Programming**
    - In order to run programs correctly, they need to be created precisely. 
        • EXAMPLE: = and == is different
        • EXAMPLE: counting from i<10 gives a different output than i<=10

- Paying careful attention to details like whitespace instructions, carefully examining 
feedback regarding whitespace differences, and then modifying a program to exactly match 
expected whitespace are exercises that strengthen attention to detail. Such attention can 
lead programmers to make fewer mistakes when creating programs, spend less time debugging, 
and instead create programs that work correctly.
