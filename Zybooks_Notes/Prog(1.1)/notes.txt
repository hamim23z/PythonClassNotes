A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time. Some of the basic instructions are:
    Input: receives data from a file, keyboard, mouse, network, etc 
    Process: performs computations on that data such as adding values
    Output: puts the data somewhere such as a file, screen, network


Algorithms: sequence of instructions that solves a problem
