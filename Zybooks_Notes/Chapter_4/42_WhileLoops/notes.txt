**While Loops**
    - While loop repeatedly executes the loop body as long as the condition is True. Basically, while the condition is True, 
    do this. And keep doing it until the condition is False. 
    - At the end of the loop body, program goes back to the while loop statement and the condition is checked again. If the
    condition is True, the loop body is executed. But if it is false, it goes out the loop body. 




**Sentinel While Loops**
    - Sentinel while loops are basically when we don't know exactly how long we want the loop to run, but it provides an option
    to quit. It's basically like enter this number to proceed or enter -1 to exit. 
    - The condition updates based on user input or external changes. 
    - For sentinel while loops, also need to always have the condition at the bottom outside of the loop again.
